			We started operating the year 2019, and that first day we sold out of every baked good by noon. 
			Over the last 5 months, we’ve learned a few things (like how to keep up with demand!), but are honored to still delight some of those very same customers.

			We, Esther and Kelvin, are a founding team behind Sweet Bakery.Kelvin is our master baker and Esther is our strategic leader. 
			We’re proud to have built a team of bakers and service professionals who delight in taking care of each other and serving our community.

			WE LOVE BEING A BAKERY
			To us, a bakery is everything that’s right with a neighborhood. 
			We love working dough in the early hours of the morning, the satisfyingly straight rows of baguette, and too-adorable-to-eat cupcakes. 
			We love putting smiles on the faces of little ones, prepping for the big meeting with a great breakfast, and giving an excuse to lingering with an old friend. 
			We love every single minute of being your Ho, Volta neighborhood Backery.

			“WE SELL HAPPINESS. IT JUST HAPPENS TO LOOK LIKE A CUPCAKE.”
